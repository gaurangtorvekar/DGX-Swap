#DGX-Swap
This repository contains the solidity code for deploying a Swap contract for Digix Gold Tokens (DGX) and a json file which contains the abi of the code in order to "watch" the contract in MIST

If you want to exchange your DGX for Ether in an OTC manner, you can use this contract code to deploy your own contract through Mist. More information about deploying this contract can be found at - https://medium.com/@attores/using-a-swap-contract-for-digixdao-badges-from-attores-e2e6c78ff0ff#.ozp8kgs2i

In order to avoid all the hassles with the deployment, Attores is providing Smart Contracts as a Service. You can sign up at http://attores.com.

Disclaimer - When you use this code, please test with small amounts of tokens and Ether. By using this code you agree that we hold no liability for losses, direct or consequential, which may result from the use of the code.
